1.  Plugin: implementing a /broadcast command
    that will both broadcast service messages
    to the chat, as a title to players and as
    an embed to a specified Discord channel.
2.  Plugin: a Telegram bot for controlling server
    related matters via a simple text command
    interface - whitelist, banning, checking
    latest N log messages and so on.
3.  Alternativ to 2: find a plugin or something
    else that allows web-based control with
    password stored in an encrypted storage
    rather than openly in a plugins subdirectory
    so configs can be safely pushed to github.
4.  Update to 1.20.x, set world border to 20k,
    gradually increase spawn radius every week
    until it reaches the grand total of 20 thousand.
5.  Plugin: giving new players a written book with
    general considerations slash rules, links
    to non-ingame chats like Discord and ways
    to contact moderators.
6.  Something else?
